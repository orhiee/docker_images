
# problem: there is an issue where the threal intel logs, intel.log is not created. 

## setup info:
* arm64:4.2.0-rc2
* complied in docker based on zeek docker build guide


## issue 1:
the critical security intell from github does not work!

## issue 2: 
folowing the issue details here https://github.com/zeek/zeek/issues/1506 still doenst work


## debugging attempts:

### notes:
* zeekctl debug - shows no errors, and intell is loaded. 
* with criticalsecurity - no intel.log is created
* following the github issue - intel.log is created but:
	* not for all domains in intell list
	* file format is checked for linux - still no fix
	* intel hits are from the x509 logs for domains, 
	* no intel.log for IP's
* format of intel is the same as the docs, with extra columns
	* removeing extra columns does not fix
*
